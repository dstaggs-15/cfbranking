        <p>This is a <strong>results-first, unbiased ranking</strong>. It is not seeded by preseason polls or brand names. It uses <em>finished games only</em> from the current season.</p>

        <h3>Step 1 — Who’s eligible</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Only <strong>FBS programs</strong> are ranked. (No Division II/III or FCS teams.)</li>
          <li>A team’s <strong>record</strong> shows every game they played against any opponent if that team is FBS (so 5–1 means five total wins and one total loss you’d recognize on TV).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 2 — Loss buckets</h3>
        <p>Teams are grouped by total losses. <strong>Fewer losses always come first.</strong> A 5–1 team is listed ahead of 4–2 by default.</p>

        <h3>Step 3 — Head-to-head inside the bucket</h3>
        <p>If two teams in the same loss group played each other, the <strong>head-to-head winner is placed ahead</strong> of the loser.</p>

        <h3>Step 4 — Composite score (used to order within buckets)</h3>
        <p>The composite score is a weighted blend of football-common-sense items:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Winning percentage (50%)</strong>: Win the games you play.</li>
          <li><strong>Strength of schedule (22%)</strong>: We measure schedule strength using only <em>FBS vs FBS</em> games. It’s the average winning percentage of your FBS opponents.</li>
          <li><strong>Average scoring margin (10%)</strong>: Scoring more than you allow matters, but we cap this so blowouts don’t dominate.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality wins</strong>: Beating teams that are roughly Top-40 (based on provisional seeding) adds credit.</li>
          <li><strong>Bad losses</strong>: Losing to roughly 80+ ranked teams deducts credit.</li>
          <li><strong>Tiny advanced flavor</strong>: We add small adjustments based on two season-long efficiency measures:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Predicted points added (offense minus defense)</strong> — how much each side increases or decreases expected points.</li>
              <li><strong>Success rate (offense minus defense)</strong> — how often plays meet the down-and-distance goal.</li>
            </ul>
            These are small tie-breakers, not the driver.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why you won’t see “random” teams up top</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Schedule strength</strong> and <strong>bad-loss penalties</strong> prevent soft slates from floating to the top.</li>
          <li><strong>Head-to-head</strong> inside the same loss group stops “you beat me but I’m ranked higher” nonsense.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><em>Translation:</em> Win a lot, against good teams, without bad stumbles, and you’ll rise. Lose more, or play cupcakes, and you won’t.</p>
